## Hi I'm Rong 👋

I'm graduating from AI Master's program at Carnegie Mellon University this Fall 2025. My background focuses on applied AI and software system development. I've worked on **LLM inference**, **generative models**, building and deploying **scalable ML infrastructures**, **GPU acceleration**, and **storage and distributed systems**. In this past summer, I was interned as an AI application engineer, architecting and deploying a semiconductor data analytics and ML pipeline to reduce latency and improve model performance. I'm actively seeking for full-time position in Software Engineer and AI Engineer. 

### Recent Highlights 🌟

#### Artificial Intelligence
- Architected an **agent orchestration system** for efficient and personalized onboarding plans using **AWS Strand**, built custom MCP servers using **AWS Bedrock** to sepcify agents' tasks, integrated **MongoDB vector search** functionality to cache large files and contents, and rapid-prototyped an MVP onboarding assistant with a **Streamlit GUI** 
- Designed and implemented a **hybrid speculative decoding strategy** that integrates Sequoia’s static tree construction with EAGLE-2’s reranking refinement to accelerate LLM inference, and **benchmarked LLaMA models** on RTX 4090 and A100 GPUs, improving decoding speedup
- Built **Llama-2 model from scratch** with rotary position embeddings (**RoPE**) and grouped-query attention (**GQA**) for long-context and memory-efficient inference
- **Fine-tuned YOLOv5** for object detection in autonomous driving, and implemented Expected-Over-Transformation based physical adversarial attack to evaluate model robustness


#### System Software
- Architected a **hybrid file system** spanning on local SSD and cloud storage, supporting **deduplication**, **snapshot**, and **caching**
- Developed a **flash translation layer** on top of SSD to translate logical addresses to physical addresses, supporting out-of-place updates, garbage collections, and **wear leveling**
- Implemented **Raft consensus algorithm** in Golang, supporting leader election, log replication, fault recovery, and snapshot
- Built a high-performance **CUDA image renderer** with a hybrid parallel algorithm, enabling efficient thread cooperation within shared memory and improving GPU utilization by 31%
- Implemented parallel algorithms for VLSI wire routing via **OpenMP** and **MPI**, utilizing quadtree data structure and Barnes-Hut algorithm to enhance spatial locality and workload balance
- Implemented a high-performance **dynamic memory allocator** levaraging segregation free list, mini-block, and footer elimnation, achieving high throughput and high memory utilization
